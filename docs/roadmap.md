# Roadmap

Our vision for Open Source Guides is to provide a jumping off point for individuals, communities, and companies to sustainably embrace open source.

### 2016: Creators

We started by focusing on open source creators, because they play a critical role in growing healthy projects. Creators help set good examples for contributors and consumers of open source. We also noticed there were very few comprehensive resources aimed at helping creators.

* [x] Create a first set of guides that help creators start and grow their own open source project
* [x] Make the guides public and release it as an open source project
* [ ] Continue to improve the content for open source creators
* [ ] Foster healthy community dynamics so the guides become a place to codify community best practices
* [ ] Improve guide discoverability for open source creators

### 2017: Contributors & Consumers

* [ ] Move [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) to the guide, and expand it to include community best practices for contributors.
* [ ] Expand the Open Source Guides to include content for open source consumers.

### Beyond

Open source is complicated, especially for newcomers. But the community has learned many lessons about the best way to use, contribute to, and produce open source software. Everyone shouldn't have to learn those lessons the hard way. To give it more prominence, we want to move it from http://opensource.guide to a permanent home on https://github.com/open-source, where it will live along side features and programs that help individuals, communities, and companies sustainably embrace open source. The content will remain open source for anyone to use.

This is our current plan. As with everything in the Open Source Guides project, it is open to community feedback.
